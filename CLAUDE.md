## Development Guidelines

### Unity Conventions
- Scene files go in `Assets/01.Scenes/`
- Follow the numbered folder naming convention (`01.Scenes`, `02.Scripts`, etc.)
- Use PascalCase for C# class names, methods, and properties
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters
- Use `[SerializeField]` for inspector-exposed private fields instead of public fields

### Git
- Main branch: `main`
- Do not commit `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, or `obj/` folders (handled by .gitignore)
- Do not commit `.sln` or `.csproj` files (auto-generated by Unity)

### Key Packages
- **2D Feature Set**: Sprite, Tilemap, Animation, Pixel Perfect
- **TextMeshPro**: For UI text rendering
- **Visual Scripting**: Available but prefer C# scripts

### Build Settings
- Default resolution: 1920x1080
